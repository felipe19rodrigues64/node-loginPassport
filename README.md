### What I need ?

* SublimeText or other file editor
* NPM
* Node JS
* Express, node network app framework
* All libs from package.json installed

### Installation

Download the project, and inside the main folder, just run the follow command for dependences installation

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Test
In app.js file, I configurated the http PORT to 3000, you can change as you wanted, so, in this example, when start this example, it will be released in localhost:3000 address :)

 - Configure your database URI in `server/models/index.js`
 - In `server/models/index.js`, by default the app will insert **user: ADM password:ADM** in the database

To test if login example is working, you can check the address localhost:3000, the application will return the login page for you to try. 

So, open your favorite Terminal and run these command.
```sh
$ node app
```
